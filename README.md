# RISCV-Processor
This is a 5-stage pipelined RISCV-32I processor. There are 2 codes in this processor. First is a 5-stage pipelined RV-32I implementation. We then expanded this by adding a distinct and independent peripheral in the Memory stage which implements the Multiplication operations. This is done as part of the EE2003:Computer Organization course in IIT Madras.
